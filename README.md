# 👋 Hi, I’m Steve Christopher (@thunder1storm)

🛡️ I’m a **Cybersecurity Analyst** passionate about:
- Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions  
- Vulnerability assessment & penetration testing  
- Digital forensics and defense  

🌱 I’m currently diving deep into:
- Advanced red teaming & adversary simulation  
- Malware reverse engineering  
- Automation using Bash and Python  

👨‍💻 I’m building tools like the **[Thunder CTF Toolkit](https://github.com/thunder1storm/thunder-ctf-toolkit)** to simplify recon and exploitation workflows for CTF players and ethical hackers.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source cybersecurity tools  
- Threat intelligence integrations  
- Write-ups for CTF platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and VulnHub
