👋 Hi, I’m @thunder1storm  
🛡️ I’m a Cybersecurity Analyst passionate about Capture The Flag (CTF), penetration testing, and digital defense.  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced red teaming, malware analysis, and automation using Bash & Python.  
👨‍💻 I’m building tools like the **Thunder CTF Toolkit** to simplify recon and exploitation workflows.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security tools, CTF write-ups, and threat intel integrations.
